# ubuntu-hello_world

### Super Minima-Stauncha-Listic!!

This super-minimalist hello_world program that runs on ubuntu, is way smaller than the one we created on the edison.

This is very useful for making sure we have node installed ok.

### Run As-Is - No Installation Necessary!!

There is no need to run "npm install" or anything (assuming you have node installed, of course).

Simply run the command:

``
node hello.js
``

And access:

* localhost:1337

in your browser (running on the same host).
